This program allows a user to obtain information about a dota 2 player by calling the dota match api for xml files, and parsing the info about the player from these games.
It should ask the user to first create a steam api key in order to call the api (I cannot be giving people my api key) (This is skipped if the user already has an api key saved (Save this in a file)
It should then ask for a player to be searched for.
Then it should show information about that player for the current patch. For example MMR, Most common role, Best 3 heroes, Most played 3 heroes, name, profile picture and more.
